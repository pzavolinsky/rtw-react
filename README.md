Reinventing the will (to code) React
====================================

This is the companion repo to a talk I gave at [MURAL](https://mural.co) called
`Reinventing the will (to code) React`.

This talk was a brief intro to DOM and virtual DOM, followed by a frenzy of code
where I tried to code a working (and much simplified) React clone in under one
hour.

While this is the code I used for the talk, in this repo I'm trying to make
things a bit more interesting by presenting you a series of code challenges. For
each challenge you can always skip ahead and check my code.

Some boring stuff follows, feel free to skip to
[Getting started](#Getting_started).

### Disclaimers

We are doing this just for fun, whatever solution we reach will probably be
worse than actual React, Vue, or other stuff. And even if we reach a brilliant
piece of code, those mainstream projects have community, maintainers, etc.

I guess what I'm trying to say is: _don't use this in production!_.

Also, I make no claim that this code has any resemblance to React at all. All
we are doing here is, given somewhat similar functional requirements, exploring
what we would've done, why and what challenges we'd have to face.

### Why even bother?

I find that trying to build something yourself gives you a unique understanding
of the problems you are facing, the (possible) mechanics of the library you are
using. In general, this exercise might give us a more refined mental model of
the workings of a virtual dom library such as React.

### Getting started

You can read everything directly from here but if you want to follow along, I
suggest you clone this repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pzavolinsky/rtw-react.git
```

Then [start the journey](docs/0-empty).

I hope you enjoy this!
